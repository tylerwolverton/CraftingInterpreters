# crafting-interpreters

A repo for my implementations of projects detailed in Bob Nystrom's book, Crafting Interpreters (here: https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html). The projects involve writing a tree walk interpreter and bytecode vm (along with their respective compilers) for the lox language as defined here: http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/appendix-i.html.

usage is: lox.exe \[filename\]
